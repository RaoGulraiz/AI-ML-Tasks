# Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing the Iris Dataset

## 🎯 Objective
Explore the Iris dataset to understand trends and feature distributions using data analysis and visualization techniques.

## 📂 Dataset
- Built-in Iris dataset from the Seaborn library
- 150 samples, 5 columns (sepal/petal length & width + species)

## ✅ Steps Performed
1. Loaded dataset using `seaborn` and `pandas`
2. Viewed dataset shape, types, summary statistics
3. Created:
   - Scatter plot for Sepal vs Petal Length
   - Histograms for feature distributions
   - Box plots to detect outliers

## 🛠️ Libraries Used
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## 📊 Key Insight
The features like petal length and width show clear separation between species, helpful for classification models in later tasks.
